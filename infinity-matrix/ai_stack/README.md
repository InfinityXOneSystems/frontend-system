# AI Stack Placeholder

This directory is reserved for future AI-driven orchestration modules.

## Planned Features

- AI-powered code analysis
- Automated code generation and refactoring
- Intelligent PR review and suggestions
- Natural language processing for issues and documentation
- Machine learning-based anomaly detection
- Predictive repository health monitoring

## Getting Started

When ready to add AI capabilities:

1. Install AI dependencies (uncomment in `requirements.txt`)
2. Configure API keys in `.env`
3. Create module files in this directory
4. Import and integrate with the autonomous agent

## Example Modules

### Code Analyzer

```python
# ai_stack/code_analyzer.py
class AICodeAnalyzer:
    def analyze(self, code):
        # AI analysis logic
        pass
```

### PR Reviewer

```python
# ai_stack/pr_reviewer.py
class PRReviewer:
    def review_pr(self, pr_diff):
        # AI review logic
        pass
```
