# Project Board Management SOP

**SOP ID**: SOP-004  
**Version**: 1.0  
**Last Updated**: Auto-generated  
**Status**: Active

## Purpose

This SOP defines procedures for managing the GitHub Project Board integration with the Infinity Matrix system.

## Scope

This document covers:
- Project Board structure and columns
- Automatic synchronization procedures
- Status transitions
- Manual interventions

## Project Board Structure

### Board Location
**URL**: https://github.com/orgs/InfinityXOneSystems/projects/1  
**Name**: Infinity-X-One-Systems Project 1

### Column Definitions

#### To Do
**Purpose**: Items that need to be worked on  
**Auto-assigned**:
- Newly created issues
- Reopened issues
- Closed but not merged PRs

#### In Progress
**Purpose**: Active work items  
**Auto-assigned**:
- Issues with assignees
- Draft pull requests
- PRs converted to draft

#### Review
**Purpose**: Items awaiting review or approval  
**Auto-assigned**:
- PRs ready for review
- PRs with review requested
- Issues awaiting validation

#### Done
**Purpose**: Completed work  
**Auto-assigned**:
- Closed issues
- Merged pull requests
- Released items

## Automatic Synchronization

### Trigger Events

The `project-board-sync.yml` workflow automatically syncs when:
- Issue is opened, reopened, closed, assigned, or labeled
- PR is opened, reopened, closed, ready for review, converted to draft, or review requested

### Sync Process

1. **Item Addition**
   - New issues/PRs are automatically added to the board
   - Items are placed in appropriate column based on state

2. **Status Updates**
   - Item states are monitored continuously
   - Column placement updated based on state changes

3. **Logging**
   - Every sync action is logged in `docs/tracking/project-board/`
   - Logs include timestamp, item details, and status

## Manual Operations

### Adding Items Manually
1. Navigate to Project Board
2. Click "Add item" button
3. Search for issue or PR
4. Select and add

### Moving Items
1. Drag item to desired column
2. System will log the manual move
3. Automated sync will respect manual placement

### Removing Items
Items should not be manually removed as they will be re-added by automation. Instead:
1. Close the issue/PR if work is complete
2. Let automation move to "Done" column

## Status Transition Rules

### Issue Lifecycle
```
Created → To Do
Assigned → In Progress
Validation needed → Review
Closed → Done
```

### PR Lifecycle
```
Draft PR → In Progress
Ready for review → Review
Approved → Review (until merged)
Merged → Done
Closed (not merged) → To Do
```

## Monitoring

### Health Checks
- Verify sync logs are generated for each event
- Check for sync delays (should be < 2 minutes)
- Validate column placement accuracy

### Common Issues

**Issue**: Item not appearing on board  
**Solution**: Check if project-board-sync workflow ran successfully

**Issue**: Item in wrong column  
**Solution**: Verify item state and manually move if needed

**Issue**: Duplicate items  
**Solution**: Remove duplicates manually; workflow should prevent this

## Integration Points

### GitHub Actions
- `project-board-sync.yml` handles all automation
- Logs stored in `docs/tracking/project-board/`

### GitHub API
- Uses GitHub's add-to-project action
- Requires appropriate permissions

### Audit Trail
- All sync operations logged
- Cross-referenced with tracking system

## Best Practices

1. **Let Automation Work**
   - Trust the automated sync process
   - Only intervene when necessary

2. **Clear Labels**
   - Use consistent labels for better tracking
   - Labels can influence column placement

3. **Regular Reviews**
   - Review board weekly
   - Close stale items
   - Update status as needed

4. **Communication**
   - Comment on items for context
   - Tag team members for visibility
   - Use discussions for complex topics

## Troubleshooting

### Sync Not Working
1. Check workflow run logs
2. Verify project board URL is correct
3. Ensure bot has project permissions
4. Check GitHub API status

### Wrong Column Placement
1. Review status transition rules
2. Check item state in GitHub
3. Manually adjust if needed
4. Report persistent issues
